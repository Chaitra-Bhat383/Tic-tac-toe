# Tic-tac-toe
A basic Discord bot which lets you pair up with a friend to play tic tac toe!

# What is a discord Bot?
One of the most unique features of the multi-level communication platform Discord is its bots. Discord bots are AIs that can perform a number of useful automated tasks and Discord bot commands on your server. Currently our bot has commands .start and .stop to start and stop the tictactoe game.We have deployed our bot to host it 24 X 7 in our server.

# Commands Used
.start @player1 @player2 ==> starts the game with 2 players

.end ==> Ends the game

.place number ==> places at the box number we specify
