# Tic-tac-toe
A basic Discord bot which lets you pair up with a friend to play tic tac toe!

# What is a discord Bot?
One of the most unique features of the multi-level communication platform Discord is its bots. Discord bots are AIs that can perform a number of useful automated tasks and Discord bot commands on your server. Currently our bot has commands .start and .stop to start and stop the tictactoe game.
